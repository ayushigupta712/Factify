                    1. Scope of License
                    This website grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the content and services strictly for personal, non-commercial, educational, or informational purposes in connection with the submission and browsing of IT-related news content. This license does not grant ownership or any rights to redistribute, resell, or modify website materials for commercial use unless explicitly authorized.

                    Scraping or mining of website data

                    Embedding or framing this website into another service

                    Commercial redistribution or publication of content without consent

                    2. License for Reporters and Publishers
                    Users who are approved as Reporters or Publishers are granted a separate, more specific license to submit original content related to IT news, innovations, trends, company updates, and more. This license remains valid as long as:

                    The submitted content is not plagiarized

                    The content does not infringe upon any third-party copyrights or trademarks

                    The user abides by all Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and Content Policies

                    The Admin Panel holds full authority to revoke, suspend, or alter the licensing terms for any contributor who violates content integrity, legal standards, or community expectations.

                    3. Intellectual Property Licensing
                    All materials on this website—including but not limited to design layouts, source code, logos, text, blog entries, images, videos, graphics, and software functionalities—are either owned by the website administrators or licensed to the website under agreements with content creators or third-party providers.

                    Users are not permitted to:

                    Copy or distribute source code or page layouts

                    Use any part of the website in AI training models or automated data extraction tools

                    Incorporate website content into publications, blogs, or courses without written permission

                    Upload or distribute modified versions of any licensed content found on the site

                    Any violation of intellectual property licensing may result in legal action, account termination, and financial damages to the fullest extent of the law.

                    4. Third-Party Licenses
                    This website may integrate third-party services, libraries, frameworks, or APIs such as Tailwind CSS for styling, QR code generation tools for payments, and analytics tools to monitor performance. Each of these third-party services is governed by its own license agreement. By using this website, you agree to comply with the licensing policies of any such third-party components. For instance:

                    Tailwind CSS is used under the MIT License.

                    Embedded widgets or analytics platforms retain their original licensing structure.

                    We encourage users to refer to the respective license documents of these third-party tools if they wish to understand their limitations or reuse potential.

                    5. User-Generated Content Licensing
                    By submitting any content (articles, headlines, visuals, promotional material, etc.) to the platform, users hereby grant the website a worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual license to:

                    Display the content publicly on the website

                    Edit or format content to meet design and quality standards

                    Promote and distribute the content across social platforms

                    Archive or store submissions for legal and historical purposes

                    This license does not grant the platform ownership over the content, but it does authorize the platform to retain and manage the material for public consumption and internal quality assurance.

                    If a user wishes to remove or modify submitted content, a formal request must be made to the Admin Panel. However, the platform reserves the right to maintain archival copies for record-keeping or legal compliance.

                    6. Restrictions and Prohibited Uses
                    The license granted by this website is subject to the following restrictions:

                    Reverse-engineering, hacking, or altering website functionality is strictly prohibited.

                    Automated crawling, scraping, or misuse of server resources violates the License terms.

                    Use of the website in any jurisdiction that does not recognize this agreement is forbidden.

                    Violating these restrictions will result in immediate revocation of the license and may expose the user to civil or criminal liability.

                    7. License Termination

                    Upon termination, the user must cease all use of website materials and may no longer access restricted sections of the platform. The website is not liable for the loss of any data due to account suspension or termination.

                    8. Amendments and Updates
                    This License Agreement is subject to periodic revision. We reserve the right to modify the terms, scope, or conditions of this license at any time to reflect changes in the platform, legal requirements, or technology standards. Continued use of the website after any update constitutes acceptance of the revised license terms.

                    Users are encouraged to revisit this License page frequently to remain informed of any changes.

                    9. Disclaimers
