                <p className='w-6xl mb-20 mt-10 text-justify'>At Factify, we are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of every individual who visits or uses our IT News Website. This Privacy Policy outlines in detail how we collect, use, process, and store your information, ensuring full transparency and trust when you interact with our services. By using this website, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

                    We collect a variety of information to enhance the user experience and maintain the integrity and functionality of our platform. This includes personal information you voluntarily submit during registration, such as your full name, email address, organization or business name, phone number, and professional background—especially when applying to become a Reporter or Publisher. This data is essential for our admin team to validate the authenticity of requests and to ensure the content published on our platform remains credible, accurate, and valuable to our readers. Additionally, if you submit news articles, advertisements, or requests to post information, those submissions may be stored and reviewed by the administrative team.

                    We also automatically collect certain technical data during your interaction with our platform. This includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser types, device information, pages visited, and access times. This data is used strictly for internal analytics to understand website traffic, diagnose technical issues, and improve our platform’s functionality and performance. We may also use cookies and similar tracking technologies to personalize your browsing experience. Cookies help us remember your preferences, login sessions, and interactions with different sections of the site. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings at any time.

                    We ensure that all collected data is stored securely using modern data protection standards. Access to user data is limited to authorized personnel only and is used solely for operational and administrative purposes. We implement encryption, firewalls, regular security audits, and access controls to ensure that your data remains protected against loss, theft, unauthorized access, or alteration.

                    In regard to financial transactions, our website displays a QR code for advertisement-related payments. We do not process or store sensitive payment information like credit card numbers or UPI IDs. All payments are handled through secure third-party platforms. Users are encouraged to verify the payment platform before proceeding, and our team is available to assist in case of any uncertainty.

                    We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third-party services. However, we may disclose your information if required to do so by law, such as in response to legal requests, government regulations, or in defense of our legal rights. Additionally, aggregated and anonymized data may be shared with third-party services for analytics, but such data will never include personally identifiable information.

                    All user data, especially from users applying as Reporters or Publishers, will be reviewed by our Admin Panel. Approval or rejection decisions are based on clear guidelines to maintain the quality and authenticity of published content. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts found to be violating our content policies, misusing the platform, or providing false information.

                    We recognize the importance of data subject rights. At any point, you have the right to access your data, request corrections or deletions, and even withdraw consent for specific uses. We aim to respond to all user requests within a reasonable timeframe and with full transparency.

                    Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use this website. We do not knowingly collect information from minors, and if such data is discovered, it will be deleted immediately upon detection.

                    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in laws, technologies, or the functionality of our website. The “Last Updated” date at the bottom of this page will always show the most recent version. We encourage users to review the policy regularly to stay informed about how their data is being used.

                    By continuing to use our services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please discontinue use of the website immediately.

                    If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback related to our privacy practices, feel free to contact our support team using the contact form provided on our site or via the official communication email.
