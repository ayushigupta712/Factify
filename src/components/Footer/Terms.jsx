These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of our platform, tools, content submission features, and services offered through this website. By registering, browsing, or submitting content, you agree to be legally bound by the following Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please discontinue use of the website immediately.

1. Platform Overview
Our website is a centralized platform dedicated to publishing, managing, and promoting news articles and content specifically related to the Information Technology (IT) sector. It serves as a gateway for individuals interested in contributing to the IT news ecosystem by registering as Reporters or Publishers. In addition, it offers an advertisement submission feature to promote IT-related services, events, or job opportunities, subject to review and approval.

2. User Registration and Role Application
To actively participate as a content contributor, you must register and apply to become either a Reporter or Publisher. All registration forms must be completed with accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable information. Submission of false or misleading data may lead to rejection, account suspension, or permanent banning from the platform. Once submitted, all applications are routed to the Admin Panel for review. The admin reserves the full right to accept, reject, or request additional information before making a decision. Approval is not guaranteed and may be withheld at the admin’s discretion to maintain the credibility and authenticity of published content.

3. Content Submission and Guidelines
All users submitting news articles, updates, or multimedia content must ensure:

Content is original and not plagiarized.

Topics are strictly IT-related, such as emerging technologies, cybersecurity, software updates, programming trends, IT events, or interviews.

Content does not contain misleading, defamatory, discriminatory, obscene, or illegal material.

Proper citations are used when referencing external information.

Submissions respect copyright laws and do not include unauthorized third-party material.

Each piece of submitted content will undergo a moderation process. The Admin Panel has the authority to approve, modify, or reject any submission based on quality, accuracy, and relevance to the IT sector. Repeated submission of substandard or irrelevant material may lead to account termination.

4. Advertisement Submission and Payment
Users can promote services or IT-related announcements through the Advertisement Module. The process includes:

Filling out a detailed ad request form.

Uploading content, banners, or promotional material.

Completing payment through the QR code provided on the payment page.

Please note:

Payment must be completed in full before the ad is reviewed.

Once payment is confirmed, no refunds will be issued under any circumstances.

The review of advertisement content may take up to 48 hours.

The admin reserves the right to refuse publication of ads that are misleading, inappropriate, or irrelevant to our audience.

5. Account Termination and Misuse
Users found to be misusing the platform, including attempting to bypass the admin panel, spreading misinformation, spamming, or engaging in unethical behavior, may have their account suspended or permanently terminated without prior notice. The platform reserves the right to take legal action in cases of serious violations, data breaches, hacking attempts, or intellectual property theft.
